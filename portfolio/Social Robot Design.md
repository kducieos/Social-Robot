## Group Work

## Case Description

We propose using the TIAGo robot under the ROSE platform for elderly care applications, focusing on four main functions:

- Help elderly people with daily tasks (such as delivering objects and information) or provide physical assistance (such as helping them stand up or sit down).

- Regularly clean and organize the elderly people's living environment (or make dynamic decisions based on the situation).

- Monitor the elderly people's health indicators, such as daily blood pressure measurement and basic urine tests, and send the data to medical staff and family members.

- Set up an alarm function to watch the elderly people's activity status. If there is any danger, send an alarm immediately.

### Selection of Useful Design Tools

- **Creative Brainstorms**: Encourage out-of-the-box ideation for new functionalities.
- **Wizard of Oz Prototyping**: Simulate robot behavior to collect early user feedback before technical development.
- **Persona Method**: Build detailed user profiles to tailor robot interaction patterns.

### Mindmap of Problem Space

*(Mindmap created — major branches: elderly daily needs, physical limitations, emotional support, health monitoring, safety concerns, social communication.)*

---

### Potential Building Blocks

- Object recognition and grasping module
- Navigation and mapping system
- Health measurement sensors
- Dialog system with context awareness
- Cleaning/maintenance accessories

---

### Functional Breakdown

| Functionality | Building Block | Testing Method |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Fetching objects | Gripper + Visual Recognition | Wizard of Oz simulation |
| Monitoring health | Sensors + Reporting System | Simulated sensor data |
| Cleaning support | Navigation + Accessories | Manual control emulation |
| Emotional support | Dialog System | Improv theatre-based evaluation |

---

### Potential Experimental Approach

- **Theatrical Exercise**:  
Use improv acting to simulate realistic elderly care scenarios, testing robot interventions. Actors play elderly users and robot puppeteers.
- **Wizard of Oz Trials**:  
Human operators control robot responses to measure emotional impact and usability before building full autonomy.

## Reflections

### How is Design Research linked to HRI

Design research promotes a deep understanding of human needs, emotions, and behaviors when interacting with robots.  
Unlike traditional engineering approaches, it emphasizes user-centered iteration and real-world contextual insights, shifting robot development from functional correctness to relational effectiveness.

---

### Digital (AI) vs Embodiment

While digital AIs (e.g., chatbots) provide functional assistance, physical embodiment offers richer, multi-sensory interaction.  
Touch, movement, presence — these create emotional resonance that pure text or voice interfaces cannot replicate. Embodied robots foster trust and engagement in ways that purely digital agents struggle to achieve.

---

### Why is "HER" (not) a Compelling Argument?

After reflecting on the movie *Her*, while digital-only relationships may offer emotional attachment, the absence of physical presence limits deep bonding.  
In my view, embodiment plays a critical role in making social interaction truly fulfilling; intangible AI lacks grounding in our sensory experience of reality.

### Reflection: The Robot Revolution - When?

The robot revolution will accelerate when robot capabilities meaningfully enhance life quality in caregiving, companionship, and personalized assistance.  
Not just efficiency, but emotional intelligence will become the key driver for widespread social robot adoption.

---

### Reflection: The Dinosaur Hotel

The failure of the Henn na Hotel highlights the gap between robotic novelty and genuine service needs.  
Flexibility, empathy, and improvisational problem-solving — traits still dominated by humans — were missing, leading to disappointing user experiences.

---

### Reflection: Nabaztag

Nabaztag represented an early attempt at physical social interfaces.  
However, its limited interactivity and inability to evolve emotionally with users prevented it from sustaining long-term engagement, highlighting the importance of continuous emotional development in social robots.

---

### Reflection: Cuddlebits

The Cuddlebits project shows that vulnerability, subtle emotional cues, and touch responsiveness can build powerful human-robot bonds — sometimes more effectively than complex intelligence.  
It reminds designers that "less" (simpler behaviors) can often be "more" (stronger emotional connection).

---

### Reflection: Be-Right-Back

The "Be-Right-Back" concept raises serious ethical concerns.  
Simulating deceased loved ones may delay emotional healing and foster dependence on illusions.  
Despite technical feasibility, emotionally and ethically, real closure — not digital echoes — remains crucial for human well-being.
